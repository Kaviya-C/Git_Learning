Here ..
how can we merge the files which is in git platform?

open the vs code

open the new terminal

there type this command as: 

git clone then copy the link of ur repository which is need to see in local machine 

eg: git clone https://github.com/Kaviya-C/Git_Learning.git

press enter

all the files which we created in git will be available now in our local machines


this is the local file which is created inside the Git_Learning folder and it is available in local machine not git platform

how to send this localFilesl.txt to the git?? 

 

lets see..

check the status of the git now
LocalFiles.txt file is in red color


u---> untracked.....
how to track------------> git add LocalFiles.txt


after done this in terminal  now check the git status
now we can see the file in green color

now u become changed as   

waiting area:
A--Staging area

now i want to send my LocalFiles.txt to the git area

for this we use the command as 

git commit -m "Give ur message about the files"

now that text file is having no warnings like 
u or a  --> untracked or staging area


after commit check the git 
but that text file is not there bcoz we send LocalFiles.txt to the Git_Learning only  not in git platform

for this we have to use the command as

main is the branch

git push origin main 
press enter

if we do this push for the very first time mean it ask some verification like mail id and password 

proceed with details then check ur git profile

Insert  -- add -- commit -- push

check the browser now ....
there we can see the LocalFiles text files there
