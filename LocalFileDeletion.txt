Here we can learn how to delete the files in local machine and if we delete any files in local machine


that should be reflected to git websites

how we can do this??

lets see...


create one demo file and add then commit then push

after doing these steps 

delete that demo file now 


check the git browser is it deleted or not?

even after refreshing it is not deleted y???

after deleting this demo files

in terminal use the command git status to check the status of the file


there we can see deleted demo.txt 
will be shown

now type git add demo.txt

add-------> not for adding the files

add--------> meant for whatever the modification done in local machine that should be reflected in git

for that purpose we git add command


git add demo.txt
git commit -m 'deleted'
git push origin main

go and check the browser now we are not able to see that deleted demo file in the git platform.
